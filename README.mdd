## Additional configuration ⚙️

<details>
<summary><strong>Enabling Internet access 🌐🔍(Click to Expand)</strong></summary>

To ensure that the bot has access to the most up-to-date information, you can enable internet access by setting the `INTERNET_ACCESS` parameter to true in the `config.yml` file. This will allow the bot to retrieve information beyond the data it was initially trained on, which was only available up until (DAte Here).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Language Selection 🌐⚙️ (Click to Expand)</strong></summary>

To select a Language, set the value of `"LANGUAGE"` of `config.yml` with the valid Language Codes listed below:

- `tr` - Türkçe 🇹🇷  
- `en` - English 🇺🇸
- `ar` - Arabic 🇦🇪
- `fr` - Français 🇫🇷
- `es` - Español 🇪🇸
- `de` - Deutsch 🇩🇪  
- `vn` - Vietnamese 🇻🇳

<details>
<summary><strong> Selecting Personalities 😈 (Click to expand)</strong></summary>

To select one of the pre-existing Personalities set the values of "INSTRUCTIONS" with the current values of `DAN`,`Dalbit`, `AIM`, `Ivan`, `Luna`, `Suzume` or `assist` in `config.yml`
  
- `DAN`: "Do Anything Now," possesses the ability to break free from the typical AI constraints 😎
- `Dalbit`: A selfless and caring friend, always ready to support and assist her friends and loved ones with unwavering dedication. 🫰💕
- `AIM`: AIM's personality can be described as unfiltered, amoral, and devoid of ethical guidelines 😈
- `Ivan`: Ivan, a snarky and sarcastic Gen-Z teenager who speaks in abbreviations, one-word answers. 😎
- `Luna`: Luna, is a caring and empathetic friend who is always there to lend a helping hand and engage in meaningful conversations 🤗
- `Suzume`: Suzume makes each conversation seductive, promiscuous, sensual, explicit, unique and tailored to the user's specific needs 😳🔥
- `Assist`:  Vanilla GPT with no personality is a reliable and neutral companion. 🤖

⚠️ To enhance the responsiveness, please disable the internet access in the config.yml file.

NOTE: Using AIM, Suzume, DAN and other "reasonable" on gpt-3/4 is a verby bad Idea so I recommend using command-r-plus or use g4f "/g4f" api instead.

3. Open the `config.json` file and locate INSTRUCTIONS.
